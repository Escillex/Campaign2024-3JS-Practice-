        <h1>Why Should I vote for you?</h1>
        <p>If you elect me I plan to help make events organized by the STCL to be more interactive and entertaining for students.
          I have noticed that most students who join these events aren't there because of the event but for the attendance. If i'm elected
          I will try to make it so that every event you come to will be an event you want to be in.
